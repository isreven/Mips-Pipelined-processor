WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2452 - The IOB PC_plus_4_pID_out_to_TB<9> is either not
   constrained (LOC) to a specific location and/or has an undefined I/O Standard
   (IOSTANDARD). This condition may seriously affect the device and will be an
   error in bitstream creation. It should be corrected by properly specifying
   the pin location and I/O Standard.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network buttons_in<3> has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 11 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   buttons_in<2>,
   buttons_in<1>,
   buttons_in<0>,
   switches_in<7>,
   switches_in<5>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 100.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   -40.000 to 100.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.
